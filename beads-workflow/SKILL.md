# Beads Workflow Guide

AI-supervised issue tracking with git-backed distributed database.

**Prefix note:** Examples use the Beads prefix for this repo (e.g., bd-xyz). If you are working in another repository, substitute that repo's issue ID prefix everywhere `{issue-id}` is shown (branch names, Feature-Key trailers, dependency IDs).

**References:**
- Beads MCP Plugin: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN.md
- Beads README: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/README.md

## Purpose

Beads provides persistent task memory across sessions, enabling:
- Feature-Key tracking across commits and PRs
- Discovering and filing new work during implementation
- Finding ready tasks with no blockers
- Managing dependencies between issues

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating or tracking issues (bugs, features, tasks)
- Finding next work ("what should I work on?")
- Updating issue status during workflow
- Managing dependencies (blocks, related, discovered-from)
- Understanding Beads integration in workflow skills
- **Creating epics with automatic branch setup**
- **Creating features with automatic branch setup**

## Epic Creation Workflow (AUTOMATED)

**When:** User confirms this is epic-level work (weeks, multiple phases)

**Steps:**
1. Set Beads context
2. Create epic with FEATURE_KEY title (sanitized from description)
3. Create phase tasks (Research → Spec → Implementation → Testing)
4. Link tasks with dependency chain
5. Create git branch: `feature-<FEATURE_KEY>`
6. Checkout branch
7. Start first task (Research)
8. Confirm to user

**Example execution:**
```typescript
// 1. Set context
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__set_context(workspace_root="/path/to/project")

// 2. Create epic
epic = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create({
  title: "AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM",
  issue_type: "epic",
  priority: 1,
  design: "OAuth + JWT + sessions + 2FA + testing",
  assignee: "claude-code"
})

// 3. Create phase tasks with auto-assigned IDs
research = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create({
  title: "Research: OAuth providers and session management",
  issue_type: "task",
  priority: 1,
  deps: [],
  id: epic.id + ".1"  // bd-xyz.1
})

spec = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create({
  title: "Spec: Authentication flow design",
  issue_type: "task",
  priority: 1,
  deps: [research.id],
  id: epic.id + ".2"  // bd-xyz.2
})

impl = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create({
  title: "Implementation: OAuth + JWT + Sessions",
  issue_type: "feature",
  priority: 1,
  deps: [spec.id],
  id: epic.id + ".3"
})

testing = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create({
  title: "Testing: E2E auth flows",
  issue_type: "task",
  priority: 1,
  deps: [impl.id],
  id: epic.id + ".4"
})

// 4. Create and checkout branch
bash: git checkout -b feature-AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM

// 5. Start first task
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update(research.id, status="in_progress")

// 6. Confirm
echo "✅ Created epic bd-xyz with 4 phase tasks
✅ Created branch feature-AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM
📍 Starting bd-xyz.1: Research

Next: Begin research phase"
```

**Branch naming:** `feature-<TITLE>` where TITLE is sanitized (uppercase, underscores, no spaces)

## Feature Creation Workflow (AUTOMATED)

**When:** User confirms this is feature-level work (days, single capability)

**Steps:**
1. Set Beads context
2. Create single feature issue
3. Create git branch: `feature-<FEATURE_KEY>`
4. Checkout branch
5. Start feature work
6. Confirm to user

**Example execution:**
```typescript
// 1. Set context
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__set_context(workspace_root="/path/to/project")

// 2. Create feature
feature = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create({
  title: "OAUTH_LOGIN_BUTTON",
  issue_type: "feature",
  priority: 2,
  design: "Single OAuth login component with Google integration",
  assignee: "claude-code"
})

// 3. Create and checkout branch
bash: git checkout -b feature-OAUTH_LOGIN_BUTTON

// 4. Start feature
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update(feature.id, status="in_progress")

// 5. Confirm
echo "✅ Created feature bd-abc
✅ Created branch feature-OAUTH_LOGIN_BUTTON
📍 Ready to implement

Next: Begin implementation"
```

## Quick Reference

## Git Hooks Integration

**Pre-commit hook (.githooks/pre-commit):**
- Auto-flushes Beads database to `.beads/issues.jsonl`
- Stages JSONL files
- Zero-lag sync before commit

**Post-merge hook (.githooks/post-merge):**
- Auto-imports JSONL changes after pull/merge
- Keeps local database in sync

**Result:** Beads database stays synchronized with git automatically.

## Workflow Patterns

### Starting Session

1. Check context:
   ```bash
   scripts/bd-context
   ```

2. Find ready work:
   ```
   mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready()
   ```

3. Claim task:
   ```
   mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update(
     issue_id="<id>",
     status="in_progress"
   )
   ```

### During Implementation

**Discover bug/TODO:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create(
  title="Bug: X doesn't handle Y",
  issue_type="bug",
  priority=1
)

mcp__plugin_beads_beads__dep(
  issue_id="<new-bug-id>",
  depends_on_id="<current-feature-id>",
  dep_type="discovered-from"
)
```

**Update progress:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update(
  issue_id="<current-id>",
  notes="Implemented X, testing Y"
)
```

### Completing Work

1. Commit:
   - Use sync-feature-branch skill
   - Auto-updates Beads status

2. Create PR:
   - Use create-pull-request skill
   - Auto-links to Beads issue

3. Close issue (after merge):
   ```
   mcp__plugin_beads_beads__close(
     issue_id="<id>",
     reason="Completed: merged PR#123"
   )
   ```

## Issue Types

**feature** - New functionality (priority 2 default)
**bug** - Defects to fix (priority 1 default)
**task** - General work (priority 2 default)
**epic** - Large features with subtasks (priority 2 default)
**chore** - Maintenance work (priority 3 default)

## Priority Levels

**0** - Critical (production down)
**1** - High (blocking work, major bugs)
**2** - Normal (features, improvements)
**3** - Low (nice-to-have)
**4** - Backlog (future consideration)

## Dependency Types

**blocks** - Hard blocker (prevents work)
**related** - Soft connection
**parent-child** - Epic → subtask
**discovered-from** - Found during parent work

Only "blocks" affects ready queue.

## Epic Workflows (Large Features)

### When to Use Epics

Use epics for features requiring multiple sub-tasks:
- Large system implementations
- Multi-phase rollouts
- Features with distinct milestones

### Creating Epics with MCP

```
epic = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create(
  title="Authentication System",
  issue_type="epic",
  priority=1,
  design="Overall architecture notes"
)

# Create sub-tasks
subtask1 = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create(
  title="JWT token generation",
  issue_type="task",
  priority=1
)

mcp__plugin_beads_beads__dep(
  issue_id=subtask1.id,
  depends_on_id=epic.id,
  dep_type="parent-child"
)
```

### Epic Patterns

**Progressive breakdown:**
1. Create epic for large feature
2. Break into tasks as design clarifies
3. Link tasks with parent-child deps
4. Track epic completion via dependencies

### Priority Filtering

**All ready tasks:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready()
```

**High-priority only:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready(priority=1)
```

## Best Practices

1. **File as you discover** - Don't lose TODO comments, file as issues
2. **Link discoveries** - Use "discovered-from" to track origin
3. **Update status** - Keep Beads current (workflow skills do this)
4. **Use Feature-Keys** - Match branch names to issue IDs
5. **Close with context** - Explain what was done in reason
6. **Check ready queue** - Start sessions with bd-ready

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Creating issues without descriptions
❌ Leaving issues in "in_progress" after completion
❌ Not linking discovered work to parent
❌ Forgetting to update status during long features
❌ Closing without reason/context

## Troubleshooting

**MCP tools not available:**
- Check: /mcp list
- Restart Claude Code if needed
- Verify bd CLI in PATH

**Database out of sync:**
- Run: bd sync
- Check: git status .beads/issues.jsonl
- Verify git hooks installed

**Issue not found:**
- List all: mcp__plugin_beads_beads__list()
- Check ID format: bd-abc123 (not just abc123)
- Verify beads initialized: ls .beads/
