# Beads Workflow Guide

AI-supervised issue tracking with git-backed distributed database.

**Prefix note:** Examples use the Beads prefix for this repo (e.g., bd-xyz). If you are working in another repository, substitute that repo's issue ID prefix everywhere `{issue-id}` is shown (branch names, Feature-Key trailers, dependency IDs).

**References:**
- Beads MCP Plugin: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN.md
- Beads README: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/README.md

## Purpose

Beads provides persistent task memory across sessions, enabling:
- Feature-Key tracking across commits and PRs
- Discovering and filing new work during implementation
- Finding ready tasks with no blockers
- Managing dependencies between issues

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating or tracking issues (bugs, features, tasks)
- Finding next work ("what should I work on?")
- Updating issue status during workflow
- Managing dependencies (blocks, related, discovered-from)
- Understanding Beads integration in workflow skills
- **Creating epics with automatic branch setup**
- **Creating features with automatic branch setup**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Set Dependencies

**Problem**: Without dependencies, `bd ready` and BV graph analysis can't identify blocked tasks or critical paths.

**Rule**: When creating ANY issue, ALWAYS ask yourself:
1. **Does this block something?** → Add `--dep` with `blocks` type
2. **Does this depend on something?** → Add `--dep` with the blocker ID
3. **Is this discovered from parent work?** → Link with `discovered-from`
4. **Is this an epic subtask?** → Link with `parent-child`

### Dependency Commands

```bash
# When creating with dependency
bd create --title "Impl: OAuth" --type feature --dep "bd-research-task"

# Add dependency to existing issue
bd dep bd-new-feature bd-required-api --type blocks

# Discovery: I found a bug while working on a feature
bd dep bd-discovered-bug bd-parent-feature --type discovered-from

# Epic subtask
bd dep bd-subtask bd-epic --type parent-child
```

### Dependency Types

| Type | Meaning | Affects Ready Queue? |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `blocks` | Hard blocker | ✅ Yes |
| `related` | Soft connection | ❌ No |
| `parent-child` | Epic hierarchy | ❌ No |
| `discovered-from` | Found during work | ❌ No |

**Only `blocks` prevents a task from appearing in `bd ready`.**

## Epic Creation Workflow (AUTOMATED)

**When:** User confirms this is epic-level work (weeks, multiple phases)

**Steps:**
1. Set Beads context
2. Create epic with FEATURE_KEY title (sanitized from description)
3. Create phase tasks (Research → Spec → Implementation → Testing)
4. Link tasks with dependency chain
5. Create git branch: `feature-<FEATURE_KEY>`
6. Checkout branch
7. Start first task (Research)
8. Confirm to user

**Example execution:**
```bash
# 1. Check context
bd-context

# 2. Create epic
# Use bd create with JSON or flags
bd create --title "AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM" --type epic --priority 1 --desc "OAuth + JWT..."

# Output: Created issue bd-xyz (AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM)

# 3. Create phase tasks
bd create --title "Research: OAuth" --type task --priority 1
# bd-xyz.1

bd create --title "Spec: Auth flow" --type task --priority 1 --dep "bd-xyz.1"
# bd-xyz.2

bd create --title "Impl: OAuth" --type feature --priority 1 --dep "bd-xyz.2"
# bd-xyz.3

# 4. Create and checkout branch
git checkout -b feature-AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM

# 5. Start first task
bd update bd-xyz.1 status=in_progress

# 6. Confirm
echo "✅ Created epic bd-xyz with phase tasks"
```

**Branch naming:** `feature-<TITLE>` where TITLE is sanitized (uppercase, underscores, no spaces)

## Feature Creation Workflow (AUTOMATED)

**When:** User confirms this is feature-level work (days, single capability)

**Steps:**
1. Set Beads context
2. Create single feature issue
3. Create git branch: `feature-<FEATURE_KEY>`
4. Checkout branch
5. Start feature work
6. Confirm to user

**Example execution:**
```bash
# 1. Check context
bd-context

# 2. Create feature
bd create --title "OAUTH_LOGIN_BUTTON" --type feature --priority 2 --desc "Single OAuth login component..."
# Output: Created issue bd-abc

# 3. Create and checkout branch
git checkout -b feature-OAUTH_LOGIN_BUTTON

# 4. Start feature
bd update bd-abc status=in_progress

# 5. Confirm
echo "✅ Created feature bd-abc"
```

## Quick Reference

### Find Work

**Ready tasks (no blockers):**
```bash
bd ready
```

**All issues:**
```bash
bd list --status open
```

**Current context:**
```bash
bd-context
```

### Track Work

**Show issue:**
```bash
bd show bd-abc123
```

**Update status:**
```bash
bd update bd-abc123 status=in_progress notes="Working on X"
```

**Complete:**
```bash
bd close bd-abc123 reason="Completed: X"
```

### Create Work

**New issue:**
```bash
bd create --title "Description" --type feature --priority 2
```

**Link to PR:**
```bash
bd-link-pr <pr-number>
```

### Manage Dependencies

**Add blocker:**
```bash
bd dep bd-new-feature bd-required-api --type blocks
```

**Track discovery:**
```bash
bd dep bd-discovered-bug bd-parent-feature --type discovered-from
```

## Integration with Workflow Skills

### sync-feature-branch

**Uses Beads:**
- Checks issue exists for Feature-Key
- Updates status to "in_progress"
- Commits with Feature-Key trailer

**When invoked:** "commit my work", "save progress"

### create-pull-request

**Uses Beads:**
- Ensures issue exists (creates if missing)
- Links PR to issue via bd-link-pr
- References issue in PR body

**When invoked:** "create PR", "merge into master"

## Git Hooks Integration

**Pre-commit hook (.githooks/pre-commit):**
- Auto-flushes Beads database to `.beads/issues.jsonl`
- Stages JSONL files
- Zero-lag sync before commit

**Post-merge hook (.githooks/post-merge):**
- Auto-imports JSONL changes after pull/merge
- Keeps local database in sync

**Result:** Beads database stays synchronized with git automatically.

## Workflow Patterns

### Starting Session

1. Check context:
   ```bash
   bd-context
   ```

2. Find ready work:
   ```
   mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready()
   ```

3. Claim task:
   ```
   mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update(
     issue_id="<id>",
     status="in_progress"
   )
   ```

### During Implementation

**Discover bug/TODO:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create(
  title="Bug: X doesn't handle Y",
  issue_type="bug",
  priority=1
)

mcp__plugin_beads_beads__dep(
  issue_id="<new-bug-id>",
  depends_on_id="<current-feature-id>",
  dep_type="discovered-from"
)
```

**Update progress:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update(
  issue_id="<current-id>",
  notes="Implemented X, testing Y"
)
```

### Completing Work

1. Commit:
   - Use sync-feature-branch skill
   - Auto-updates Beads status

2. Create PR:
   - Use create-pull-request skill
   - Auto-links to Beads issue

3. Close issue (after merge):
   ```
   mcp__plugin_beads_beads__close(
     issue_id="<id>",
     reason="Completed: merged PR#123"
   )
   ```

## Issue Types

**feature** - New functionality (priority 2 default)
**bug** - Defects to fix (priority 1 default)
**task** - General work (priority 2 default)
**epic** - Large features with subtasks (priority 2 default)
**chore** - Maintenance work (priority 3 default)

## Priority Levels

**0** - Critical (production down)
**1** - High (blocking work, major bugs)
**2** - Normal (features, improvements)
**3** - Low (nice-to-have)
**4** - Backlog (future consideration)

## Dependency Types

**blocks** - Hard blocker (prevents work)
**related** - Soft connection
**parent-child** - Epic → subtask
**discovered-from** - Found during parent work

Only "blocks" affects ready queue.

## Epic Workflows (Large Features)

### When to Use Epics

Use epics for features requiring multiple sub-tasks:
- Large system implementations
- Multi-phase rollouts
- Features with distinct milestones

### Creating Epics with MCP

```
epic = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create(
  title="Authentication System",
  issue_type="epic",
  priority=1,
  design="Overall architecture notes"
)

# Create sub-tasks
subtask1 = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create(
  title="JWT token generation",
  issue_type="task",
  priority=1
)

mcp__plugin_beads_beads__dep(
  issue_id=subtask1.id,
  depends_on_id=epic.id,
  dep_type="parent-child"
)
```

### Epic Patterns

**Progressive breakdown:**
1. Create epic for large feature
2. Break into tasks as design clarifies
3. Link tasks with parent-child deps
4. Track epic completion via dependencies

### Priority Filtering

**All ready tasks:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready()
```

**High-priority only:**
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready(priority=1)
```

## Best Practices

1. **File as you discover** - Don't lose TODO comments, file as issues
2. **Link discoveries** - Use "discovered-from" to track origin
3. **Update status** - Keep Beads current (workflow skills do this)
4. **Use Feature-Keys** - Match branch names to issue IDs
5. **Close with context** - Explain what was done in reason
6. **Check ready queue** - Start sessions with bd-ready

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Creating issues without descriptions
❌ Leaving issues in "in_progress" after completion
❌ Not linking discovered work to parent
❌ Forgetting to update status during long features
❌ Closing without reason/context

## Troubleshooting
 
**Beads CLI not found:**
- Check: `which bd`
- Ensure `~/bin` or `scripts/` in PATH
 
**Database out of sync:**
- Run: `bd sync`
- Check: `git status .beads/issues.jsonl`
- Verify git hooks installed
 
**Issue not found:**
- List all: `bd list --status open`
- Check ID format: `bd-abc123` (not just abc123)
- Verify beads initialized: `ls .beads/`
