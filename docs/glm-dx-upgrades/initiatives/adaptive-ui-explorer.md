# Adaptive UI Explorer (GLM-4.6v)

Autonomous QA that doesn't just follow stories, but 'hunts' for bugs based on product missions.

### Persona Grounding
- **Prime Radiant:** Retail Investor focusing on brokerage sync and analytics.
- **Affordabot:** Legislator/Educated Voter focusing on cost-of-living policy analysis.

### Workflow
1. **Assign Mission:** "Verify the Plaid linking flow works for a new user with 2FA."
2. **Autonomous Loop:** Vision-based observation -> Decision -> Action.
3. **Bug Capture:** If a goal fails or UI breaks, auto-categorize and log a P0/P1 in Beads.
4. **Fix Handoff:** (Future) Auto-dispatch Jules to fix the logged bug.
