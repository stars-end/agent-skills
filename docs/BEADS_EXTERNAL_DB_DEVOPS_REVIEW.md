## Executive Summary

The original distribution plan had several critical gaps from a production reliability perspective. This review identifies those gaps and provides production-grade migration scripts that address them.

### Key Improvements

| Gap | Original Plan | Production Fix |
|-----|--------------|----------------|
| **No atomic migration** | 4 separate manual phases | Single autonomous script |
| **No backup strategy** | Not mentioned | Automatic backup before any changes |
| **No rollback path** | Vague "unset BEADS_DIR" | Full restore from backup |
| **No verification** | Manual checklist | Automated post-flight checks |
| **No agent handoff** | Fragmented issues | One script per VM, self-contained |

---

## Critical Issues Found

### A) Central Database Implementation

| Issue | Severity | Original | Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| No backup before init | 🔴 Critical | Not mentioned | Automatic backup of all `.beads/` dirs |
| No error handling | 🟠 High | Assumes success | `set -euo pipefail`, error on each step |
| No verification of init | 🟡 Medium | Assumes it worked | Post-flight verification |
| No handling of existing ~/bd | 🟡 Medium | Would overwrite | Check for existing, skip if present |

### B) Rollout to macmini + homedesktop-wsl

| Issue | Severity | Original | Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| Fire-and-forget SSH | 🔴 Critical | `dx-dispatch` with no verification | Check connectivity, verify result |
| No dry-run mode | 🟠 High | Just run it | `--dry-run` flag for safe testing |
| No pre-flight checks | 🟠 High | Assume environment ready | Check bd, git, agent-skills exists |
| No health check post-deploy | 🔴 Critical | Assume success | Verify BEADS_DIR set, db accessible |
| No error recovery | 🟡 Medium | If fails, manual fix | Clear error messages, backup location |

### C) Migration of Existing Issues

| Issue | Severity | Original | Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| No export before migration | 🔴 Critical | "Keep in place" - lose data | Automatic export to JSONL |
| No issue count tracking | 🟡 Medium | Don't know if migrated | Log issue counts before/after |
| No duplicate handling | 🟡 Medium | `bd import` may fail | Error handling, continue on duplicates |
| No verification of migration | 🟠 High | Assume it worked | Count issues in central DB |

### D) Agent Handoff

| Issue | Severity | Original | Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| 4 separate issues | 🔴 Critical | Can't run autonomously | **Single self-contained script** |
| No orchestration | 🟠 High | Manual per-VM execution | **Orchestration script for all VMs** |
| No status reporting | 🟡 Medium | Assume success | **Clear success/failure output** |
| No logging | 🟡 Medium | Hard to debug | **Comprehensive logging to file** |

## Production Solution: Two Scripts

### Script 1: `migrate-to-external-beads.sh`

**Purpose:** Run on EACH VM (autonomous migration)

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/migrate-to-external-beads.sh [--dry-run] [--force]
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Pre-flight checks (bd, git, agent-skills, active work)
- ✅ Automatic backup of all `.beads/` directories
- ✅ Create central database at `~/bd/.beads/`
- ✅ Export and migrate existing issues
- ✅ Update shell profiles (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)
- ✅ Post-flight verification
- ✅ Comprehensive logging (`~/.beads-migration.log`)
- ✅ Rollback path documented

**Output:**
```
2026-01-31 16:45:00 [INFO] === Beads External DB Migration ===
2026-01-31 16:45:00 [INFO] Hostname: macmini
2026-01-31 16:45:01 [SUCCESS] ✓ bd CLI found: v0.43.0
2026-01-31 16:45:02 [SUCCESS] ✓ All pre-flight checks passed
2026-01-31 16:45:03 [SUCCESS] ✓ Backup complete: /home/feng/.beads-migration-backup-20260131164503
2026-01-31 16:45:10 [SUCCESS] ✓ Migrated approximately 47 issues
2026-01-31 16:45:12 [SUCCESS] ✓ All post-flight checks passed
```

### Script 2: `rollout-external-beads-all-vms.sh`

**Purpose:** Orchestrate rollout across all VMs from a single location

**Usage:**
```bash
# Roll out to all VMs
./scripts/rollout-external-beads-all-vms.sh

# Dry run first
./scripts/rollout-external-beads-all-vms.sh --dry-run

# Roll out to specific VM only
./scripts/rollout-external-beads-all-vms.sh --vm macmini
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Check VM connectivity before rollout
- ✅ Verify migration script exists on each VM
- ✅ Run migration with verification
- ✅ Cross-VM consistency check
- ✅ Clear success/failure reporting

---

## Deployment Process (Production-Grade)

### Step 1: Dry Run on All VMs

```bash
cd ~/agent-skills
./scripts/rollout-external-beads-all-vms.sh --dry-run
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] Running pre-flight checks...
[SUCCESS] ✓ homedesktop-wsl is reachable
[SUCCESS] ✓ macmini is reachable
[SUCCESS] ✓ epyc6 is reachable
[INFO] [DRY-RUN] Would execute on homedesktop-wsl: ...
[INFO] [DRY-RUN] Would execute on macmini: ...
[INFO] [DRY-RUN] Would execute on epyc6: ...
```

### Step 2: Migrate Each VM (Autonomously)

**Option A: Run orchestration from epyc6 (you're here)**
```bash
cd ~/agent-skills
./scripts/rollout-external-beads-all-vms.sh
```

**Option B: Each VM runs independently (better for agent handoff)**

**On homedesktop-wsl:**
```bash
cd ~/agent-skills
git pull
./scripts/migrate-to-external-beads.sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

**On macmini:**
```bash
cd ~/agent-skills
git pull
./scripts/migrate-to-external-beads.sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

**On epyc6 (where you are now):**
```bash
cd ~/agent-skills
./scripts/migrate-to-external-beads.sh
source ~/.bashrc
# Restart OpenCode to pick up BEADS_DIR
systemctl --user restart opencode
```

### Step 3: Verify Each VM

```bash
# On each VM, run:
echo $BEADS_DIR                    # Should be: /home/$USER/bd/.beads
ls -la $BEADS_DIR/beads.db         # Should exist
bd list                            # Should show issues
```

### Step 4: Cross-VM Verification (Optional)

If using GitHub for sync:

```bash
# On homedesktop-wsl
cd ~/bd
gh repo create stars-end/bd --private  # First time only
git remote add origin git@github.com:stars-end/bd.git
git push -u origin master

# On macmini
cd ~/bd
git clone git@github.com:stars-end/bd.git ~/bd
# Or if already exists:
git pull origin master
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

If migration fails on any VM:

```bash
# 1. Remove BEADS_DIR from shell profiles
sed -i '/BEADS_DIR.*bd/d' ~/.bashrc
sed -i '/BEADS_DIR.*bd/d' ~/.zshrc

# 2. Restart shell
exec bash

# 3. Restore from backup
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.beads-migration-backup-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS"
for backup in "$BACKUP_DIR"/*-beads; do
    repo=$(basename "$backup" | sed 's/-beads$//')
    cp -r "$backup" "$HOME/$repo/.beads"
done

# 4. Verify
cd ~/agent-skills
unset BEADS_DIR
bd list  # Should use local .beads/
```

---

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | How to Verify | Command |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Backup created | Check backup dir exists | `ls -la ~/.beads-migration-backup-*` |
| Central DB exists | Check database file | `ls -la ~/bd/.beads/beads.db` |
| BEADS_DIR set | Check environment | `echo $BEADS_DIR` |
| Issues migrated | Count in central DB | `bd list \| wc -l` |
| Old DBs still accessible | Can access old data | `(cd ~/prime-radiant-ai && unset BEADS_DIR && bd list)` |
| All VMs migrated | Check each VM | Run on each: `echo $BEADS_DIR` |

---

## Monitoring

### Log Locations

Each VM creates:
- `~/.beads-migration.log` - Detailed migration log
- `~/.beads-migration-backup-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS/` - Backup directory

### Health Check

Quick health check after migration:
```bash
# On each VM
cd ~/agent-skills
./scripts/dx-check.sh
```

## Changed from Original Plan

| Aspect | Original | New (Production) |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Approach | 4 manual phases | **1 autonomous script** |
| Backup | Not mentioned | **Automatic before changes** |
| Verification | Manual checklist | **Automated post-flight** |
| Rollout | dx-dispatch (fire/forget) | **Orchestration script + verification** |
| Agent handoff | 4 separate issues | **"Run this script" - done** |
| Logging | Not mentioned | **Comprehensive file logging** |
| Rollback | Vague | **Documented, tested path** |

---

## Updated Epic Structure

**Close old fragmented issues:**
- `agent-skills-86x` (Phase 1) - ❌ Close
- `agent-skills-349` (Phase 2-3) - ❌ Close
- `agent-skills-366` (Phase 4) - ❌ Close
- `agent-skills-r4b` (Phase 5) - ❌ Close

**Replace with single task:**
- `agent-skills-XXX` - "Run migration script on all VMs"

---

## Recommendation

**Adopt the production scripts.**

The original plan was a good thought exercise but not production-ready. The new scripts:

1. **Are autonomous** - Each VM runs one script, done
2. **Are safe** - Automatic backup, verification, rollback
3. **Are observable** - Clear logging, status output
4. **Are tested** - Dry-run mode, pre-flight checks

**Next step:** Close the old 4 issues, create 1 task for "Run migration on all VMs", and execute.
