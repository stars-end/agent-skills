#### Summary
| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Rescue branches (canonical violations) | 0 | ✅ OK |
| Commits missing Feature-Key | 0 | ✅ OK |
| PRs with auto-merge enabled | 0 | ✅ OK |
| Stale PRs (>7d) | 0 | ✅ OK |

#### Analysis Prompt for OpenClawd
When reading this section, consider:
1. Rescue branches indicate agents editing canonical repos directly (V8 violation)
2. Missing Feature-Key means commits aren't linked to beads issues
3. Auto-merge should NEVER be enabled (humans merge)
4. Stale PRs may indicate blocked work or forgotten branches
5. Look for TRENDS: is the situation improving or degrading?

If violations detected, suggest which agent/VM may be responsible based on
rescue branch naming pattern: `rescue-<hostname>-<repo>`
