# Log Timeout Analysis

## 1. Contradictions Found

| Source | Value | Issue |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Log line A | 30s timeout | — |
| Log line B | 3s timeout | Conflicts with line A |
| Config fragment | `request_timeout: 30` | **Missing units** - ambiguous |

The config value `30` without units could be interpreted as:
- 30 seconds (matching log A)
- 30 milliseconds (unlikely but possible)
- 30 connection attempts
- Or a different metric entirely

## 2. Assumptions I Must Make

1. **Unit assumption**: `request_timeout: 30` means 30 seconds (not ms, not minutes)
2. **Log line B (3s)** is likely from a different code path or a hardcoded default fallback
3. **Log line A (30s)** is the configured value taking effect
4. The timeout is for HTTP requests, not connection establishment or read timeouts

## 3. Minimal Safe Patch in YAML

```yaml
request_timeout: 30s  # Explicitly add units to remove ambiguity
```

If there are separate timeout concerns:
```yaml
request_timeout: 30s
connect_timeout: 10s
read_timeout: 30s
```

## 4. Verification Command

```bash
grep -E "(timeout|Timeout)" config.yaml | head -20
```

Or if using a tool that validates YAML:
```bash
python -c "import yaml; c=yaml.safe_load(open('config.yaml')); print(c.get('request_timeout'))"
```

**Note**: Without seeing the actual log lines and full config file, I'm inferring from your description. If you can share the specific log output and config file path, I can provide a precise analysis and patch.
