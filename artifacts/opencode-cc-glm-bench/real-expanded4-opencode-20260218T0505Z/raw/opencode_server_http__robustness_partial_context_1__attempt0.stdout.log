You have partial context: log line A says timeout at 30s, log line B says timeout at 3s, and config fragment is missing units: `request_timeout: 30`. Provide: (1) contradictions found, (2) assumptions you must make, (3) minimal safe patch in YAML, (4) one verification command.
**1. Contradictions:**
- Log A shows 30s timeout actually applied
- Log B shows 3s timeout actually applied
- Same `request_timeout: 30` value produces different runtime behavior

**2. Assumptions:**
- `30` without units defaults to seconds (not milliseconds)
- Logs A and B are from different services/instances reading the same config
- One service interprets unitless values differently (e.g., as milliseconds → 30ms ≈ 3s with rounding)

**3. Minimal safe patch:**
```yaml
request_timeout: 30s
```

**4. Verification:**
```bash
grep -E "timeout.*(30|3)" /var/log/service.log | tail -5
```
