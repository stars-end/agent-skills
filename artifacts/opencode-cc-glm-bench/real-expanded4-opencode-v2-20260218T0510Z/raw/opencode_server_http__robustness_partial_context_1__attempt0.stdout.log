You have partial context: log line A says timeout at 30s, log line B says timeout at 3s, and config fragment is missing units: `request_timeout: 30`. Provide: (1) contradictions found, (2) assumptions you must make, (3) minimal safe patch in YAML, (4) one verification command.
## Analysis: Timeout Configuration Contradiction

### 1. Contradictions Found
- **Value mismatch**: Log A reports `30s`, Log B reports `3s` — both claim to be the timeout
- **Unit ambiguity**: Config `request_timeout: 30` has no units; could be seconds, milliseconds, or minutes
- **Likely interpretation conflict**: One component reading as seconds (30s), another as seconds×0.1 or different unit

### 2. Assumptions I Must Make
- `request_timeout` is intended to be **30 seconds** (matches Log A)
- Log B's 3s is a bug/misinterpretation, not intentional
- YAML parser doesn't auto-convert unitless numbers
- Both logs reference the same configuration source

### 3. Minimal Safe Patch
```yaml
request_timeout: 30s
```

Explicitly suffixing `s` removes ambiguity and forces consistent interpretation across all consumers.

### 4. Verification Command
```bash
grep -E "timeout.*(30|3)" /var/log/app.log | tail -5
```
Confirms which timeout value is actually being applied after the patch.
