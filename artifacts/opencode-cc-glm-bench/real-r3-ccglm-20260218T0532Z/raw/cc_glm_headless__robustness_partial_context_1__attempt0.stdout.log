# Analysis: Request Timeout Configuration Issue

Based on the partial context you've provided, let me analyze the timeout configuration problem.

## 1) Contradictions Found

| Source | Value | Issue |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Log line A | timeout at **30s** | Matches config value |
| Log line B | timeout at **3s** | **Contradicts** config (10x faster) |
| Config fragment | `request_timeout: 30` | **Missing units** - could be seconds or milliseconds |

**Key contradiction**: Log line B shows 3s timeout while config shows 30 (with unclear units). This suggests either:
- Config value is being interpreted as milliseconds (30ms ≈ 3s after network overhead)
- A default fallback is being used
- Different code paths are reading different configs

## 2) Assumptions Required

1. **Assume the config key is correct** - `request_timeout` is the right field name
2. **Assume the library expects explicit units** - The 3s vs 30s gap suggests implicit defaults
3. **Assume YAML number without units defaults to seconds** (common pattern)
4. **Assume log line B is the symptom** - 3s is the unexpected behavior we're fixing

## 3) Minimal Safe Patch

```yaml
# BEFORE (ambiguous)
request_timeout: 30

# AFTER (explicit units)
request_timeout: 30s
```

**Rationale**: Adding the `s` suffix makes the units explicit. Most timeout libraries (hyper, reqwest, httpx) support this notation. If the library requires milliseconds:

```yaml
# Alternative if library requires ms
request_timeout: 30000
```

## 4) Verification Command

```bash
# Grep for timeout-related config to confirm the fix is applied
grep -r "request_timeout" config/ && \
# Check runtime logs for the new timeout value
tail -f logs/*.log | grep -i timeout
```

---

**Recommendation**: First check what library/framework you're using to confirm the expected format. For example:
- **Python httpx**: `"30s"` or `30.0` (seconds as float)
- **Rust reqwest**: `Duration::from_secs(30)`
- **Node.js**: milliseconds as integer `30000`

Do you have the actual config file or library documentation I can reference to give you a precise fix?
