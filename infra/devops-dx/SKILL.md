# DevOps DX Helper

Lightweight playbook for CI/Railway env hygiene. Examples use this repo's Beads prefix (bd-); swap for your repo.

## Railway GraphQL Integration (NEW)

For comprehensive Railway environment validation, use the GraphQL-based validation script:

```bash
# Validate linked Railway project
~/.agent/skills/devops-dx/scripts/validate_railway_env.sh

# Validate specific project
~/.agent/skills/devops-dx/scripts/validate_railway_env.sh --project-id <PROJECT_ID>

# Validate specific service
~/.agent/skills/devops-dx/scripts/validate_railway_env.sh --service <SERVICE_NAME>
```

**Features:**
- Fetches full environment configuration via GraphQL API
- Detects staged (unapplied) changes
- Validates required environment variables
- Checks for build/start command conflicts
- Lists all services and their configuration
- Cross-agent compatible (works with skills-native and MCP agents)

## Common Tasks

- **Set GitHub Actions variables** (non-secret paths, stub fixtures):
  - `gh variable set CLERK_TEST_JWKS_PATH --body "frontend/e2e-smoke/fixtures/clerk-test-jwks.json"`
  - `gh variable set CLERK_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH --body "frontend/e2e-smoke/fixtures/clerk-test-private.pem"`

- **Set GitHub Actions secrets** (API keys, tokens):
  - `gh secret set ZAI_API_KEY <<<"…"`
  - `gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY <<<"…"`

- **Sync Railway → GitHub secrets** (if already stored in Railway):
  - `scripts/sync_env_to_github.sh <environment> [service]`
    - Copies Railway env vars to GitHub repo secrets (keys sanitized for GH).

## When CI Fails for Missing Env

1) Identify missing var from logs (e.g., `CLERK_TEST_JWKS_PATH missing`).
2) Decide scope:
   - CI-only → set via `gh variable/secret set`.
   - Runtime (Railway) → set in Railway dashboard or `railway variables set`.
3) Re-run the affected workflow: `gh workflow run CI --ref master`.

## Notes

- Keep stub/test fixtures in GH Actions vars, not Railway.
- Use Railway for production secrets; keep CI-only secrets separate.
- For multi-repo, reuse this skill and adjust variable names/prefixes per repo.
