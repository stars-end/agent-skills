  End Claude Code session with Beads sync and summary. MUST BE USED when user says they're done, ending session, or logging off.
  Guarantees Beads export to git, shows session stats, and suggests next ready work. Handles cleanup and context saving.
  Use when user says "goodbye", "bye", "done for now", "logging off",
  or when user mentions end-of-session, session termination, cleanup, context saving,
  bd sync, or export operations.

# Session End

End session cleanly with Beads export, stats, and next work suggestion.

## Canonical Beads Location (P0 Rule)

Run `bd` commands from `~/bd` only (canonical `stars-end/bd` repo).  
Do not run Beads sync/export from product repos.

## Workflow

### 1. Set Beads Context
```
mcp__plugin_beads_beads__set_context(workspace_root="/path/to/project")
```

### 2. Force Beads Sync
**CRITICAL:** Beads auto-sync has 30s debounce. Session end requires explicit sync.

```bash
bd sync
```

**What this does:**
- Exports all changes to `.beads/issues.jsonl`
- Commits changes to git
- Pushes to remote (if configured)
- Guarantees persistence across sessions

### 3. Get Session Stats
```
stats = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__stats()
```

Show relevant metrics:
- Issues closed this session
- Issues created this session
- Current epic progress
- Total ready work available

### 4. Suggest Next Work
```
readyTasks = mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready(priority=1)
```

Show top 3-5 ready tasks by priority:
- Unblocked P1 issues
- Next phase tasks in current epic
- High-value backlog items

### 5. Verify Canonicals Are Clean (V7.6)

Run the invariant check before claiming you're “done”:

```bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-verify-clean.sh
```

### 6. Context Summary

Show what to resume in next session:
```
📊 Session Summary

Issues Closed: 3
  • bd-xpi.4 (Testing)
  • bd-xpi.4.1 (Bug: SessionStart permission)
  • bd-xpi.4.2 (Bug: UserPromptSubmit JSON)

Issues Created: 2
  • bd-xpi.4.1 (discovered-from bd-xpi.4)
  • bd-xpi.4.2 (discovered-from bd-xpi.4)

Current Work:
  bd-xpi.5 (in_progress): Implementation Part 2
  Epic: bd-xpi (DX_V3_BEADS_INTEGRATION)

✅ Beads synced to git
✅ Canonicals verified clean

📍 Next Session:
  Top ready tasks:
  1. bd-xpi.5 (P1) - Continue implementation
  2. bd-abc.3 (P1) - API integration testing
  3. bd-def.2 (P2) - Documentation updates

Say "bd ready" to see full ready work queue
```

## Best Practices

- **Always call at session end** - Guarantees Beads persistence
- **Don't skip sync** - Auto-sync may not fire before session terminates
- **Review stats** - Understand what was accomplished
- **Note next work** - Reduces context switching overhead in next session
- **Git status clean** - Commit all work before session-end

## Common Usage

**User signals:**
- "I'm done for today"
- "Ending session"
- "Log off"
- "Save and exit"
- "That's all for now"

**Skill auto-detects** these phrases via skill-rules.json patterns.

## What This DOESN'T Do

- ❌ Create new issues (use beads-workflow for that)
- ❌ Commit code (use sync-feature-branch first)
- ❌ Close ongoing work (only syncs state)

**Philosophy:** Clean exits + Context preservation + Ready for next session
