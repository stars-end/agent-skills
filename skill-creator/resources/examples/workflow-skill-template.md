# Workflow Skill Template

Template for creating workflow skills that automate multi-step processes.

## When to Use This Template

Use this template when creating a skill that:
- Automates a repetitive process (>5 steps manually)
- Has clear start and end points
- Involves multiple systems (git, Beads, Serena, CI, etc.)
- Saves measurable time (minutes → seconds)

**Examples:** sync-feature-branch, create-pull-request, fix-pr-feedback

# Workflow Name

One-line purpose (<time> total).

## Purpose

[What this workflow automates and why it exists]

**Philosophy:** [Core principle - e.g., "Fast commits + Trust CI"]

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger phrases:**
- "[natural language phrase 1]"
- "[natural language phrase 2]"
- "[natural language phrase 3]"

**Automatically invoked when:**
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]

## Workflow

### 1. [Check Context / Verify Prerequisites]

[What to check before starting]

```[language]
# Verification code
```

**Fail fast if:**
- [Critical prerequisite missing]
- [Blocking condition]

### 2. [Gather Information]

[Use Serena/Beads/git to get current state]

**A. [Information source 1]**
```[language]
# How to get info
```

**B. [Information source 2]**
```[language]
# How to get info
```

### 3. [Execute Core Action]

[Main workflow steps (3-7 steps typically)]

**Step 1: [Action name]**
```[language]
# Implementation
```

**Step 2: [Action name]**
```[language]
# Implementation
```

### 4. [Validate Results]

[Quick checks (<5s), trust environments for full validation]

```[language]
# Validation code
```

### 5. [Update State]

[Commit changes, update Beads, confirm to user]

```[language]
# State update code
```

**Confirm to user:**
```
✅ [What was accomplished]
✅ [Side effect 1]
✅ [Side effect 2]

Next: [What user should do next]
```

## Integration Points

- **Navigate:** `mcp__serena__find_symbol(...)`
- **Edit:** `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body(...)`
- **Insert:** `mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol(...)`

**Pattern:**
```[language]
# Serena integration example
```

### With Git

[How this skill uses git]

- **Status:** `git status`, `git branch --show-current`
- **Changes:** `git add`, `git commit`

**Pattern:**
```bash
# Git integration example
```

## Workflow Skill Checklist

When creating a workflow skill, ensure:

- [ ] Clear trigger phrases (3-5 natural language patterns)
- [ ] Fast execution time (<1 minute ideal)
- [ ] Quick validation only (<5s), trust environments
- [ ] Proper Beads integration (check/create/update/close)
- [ ] Serena-first for code operations (not bash)
- [ ] Git operations follow conventions (Feature-Key trailers)
- [ ] Error handling (fail fast, clear messages)
- [ ] User confirmation (show what happened)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure (<500 lines main file)
- [ ] Examples (simple, complex, edge case)
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] Best practices and anti-patterns listed

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Check-Execute-Update Pattern

```
1. Check prerequisites (fail fast)
2. Execute core workflow
3. Update state (Beads, git, etc.)
4. Confirm to user
```

**Use for:** Most workflow skills

### Discover-Fix-Track Pattern

```
1. Discover problems
2. Categorize by severity
3. Fix simple, ask for complex
4. Track in Beads
5. Update and confirm
```

**Use for:** PR feedback, debugging, cleanup workflows

### Gather-Transform-Commit Pattern

```
1. Gather current state
2. Transform (code changes, data processing)
3. Validate transformation
4. Commit results
5. Confirm
```

**Use for:** Code generation, refactoring, data migration

## Time Budget Guidelines

| Operation Type | Time Budget |
|----------------|-------------|
| Quick commits | <30s |
| PR creation | <10s |
| PR fixes | <2min per issue |
| Code search | <5s |
| Validation | <5s (quick checks only) |
| Full workflow | <1min ideal |

## Integration Checklist

### Beads Integration

- [ ] Call `set_context()` at start
- [ ] Check issue exists (create if missing)
- [ ] Update status during workflow
- [ ] Close on success with reason
- [ ] Create child issues for discoveries
- [ ] Link with discovered-from

### Serena Integration

- [ ] Use `search_for_pattern` instead of grep
- [ ] Use `list_dir` instead of find
- [ ] Use `get_symbols_overview` before reading files
- [ ] Use `find_symbol` for targeted reads
- [ ] Use `replace_symbol_body` for symbol edits
- [ ] Use `insert_after_symbol` for additions

### Git Integration

- [ ] Extract Feature-Key from branch name
- [ ] Include Feature-Key in commit trailers
- [ ] Add Agent and Role trailers
- [ ] Push to correct remote
- [ ] Use gh CLI for PR operations
- [ ] Handle git errors gracefully

## Testing Workflow Skills

### Test Cases

1. **Happy path:** All prerequisites met, workflow succeeds
2. **Missing prerequisites:** Fail fast with clear message
3. **Partial success:** Some steps succeed, others fail gracefully
4. **Discovery during execution:** Create child issues, continue
5. **External failures:** CI failures, network errors, API errors

### Test Execution

```bash
# 1. Test auto-activation
User says: "[trigger phrase]"
→ Verify hook detects it
→ Verify skill invoked

# 2. Test workflow
Follow skill steps
→ Check each step works
→ Verify Beads updated
→ Verify git operations succeed

# 3. Test edge cases
Missing branch name
→ Skill fails gracefully

Missing Beads issue
→ Skill creates proactively

CI failure
→ Skill completes, CI runs async
```

3. Create PR with gh CLI
4. Link PR to Beads
5. Confirm to user

### fix-pr-feedback

**Type:** Discover-Fix-Track
**Time:** 2min per issue
**Pattern:**

2. Categorize discoveries
3. Create child Beads issues
4. Fix simple, ask for complex
5. Commit fixes with child Feature-Keys
6. Close child issues
