# DX Global Constraints (V8)
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT -->

## 1) Canonical Repository Rules
**Canonical repositories** (read-mostly clones):
- `~/agent-skills`
- `~/prime-radiant-ai`
- `~/affordabot`
- `~/llm-common`

### Enforcement
**Primary**: Git pre-commit hook blocks commits when not in worktree
**Safety net**: Daily sync to origin/master (non-destructive)

### Workflow
Always use worktrees for development:
```bash
dx-worktree create bd-xxxx repo-name
cd /tmp/agents/bd-xxxx/repo-name
# Work here
```

## 2) V8 DX Automation Rules
1. **No auto-merge**: never enable auto-merge on PRs — humans merge
2. **No PR factory**: one PR per meaningful unit of work
3. **No canonical writes**: always use worktrees
4. **Feature-Key mandatory**: every commit needs `Feature-Key: bd-<beads-id>`

## 3) PR Metadata Rules (Blocking In CI)
- **PR title must include a Feature-Key**: include `bd-<beads-id>` somewhere in the title (e.g. `bd-f6fh: ...`)
- **PR body must include Agent**: add a line like `Agent: <agent-id>`

Notes:
- PR metadata enforcement exists to keep squash merges ergonomic (don’t rely on commit messages).
- If you’re unsure what to use for Agent, use your platform id (see `DX_AGENT_ID.md`).
