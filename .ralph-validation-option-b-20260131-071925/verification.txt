    [07:19:28] Description: Add mise trust call after worktree creation in Ralph scripts.
    
    ## Implementation
    - In run_single_task(), after worktree creation:
      `mise trust --yes $worktree/.mise.toml 2>/dev/null || true`
    
    ## Why
    - Ensures tool versions are correct in worktree
    - Consistent with dx-dispatch behavior
    - Prevents tool version mismatches
