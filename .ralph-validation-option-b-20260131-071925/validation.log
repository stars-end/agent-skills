[07:19:28] Description: Add mise trust call after worktree creation in Ralph scripts.

## Implementation
- In run_single_task(), after worktree creation:
  `mise trust --yes $worktree/.mise.toml 2>/dev/null || true`

## Why
- Ensures tool versions are correct in worktree
- Consistent with dx-dispatch behavior
- Prevents tool version mismatches
